      "content_plain_text": "The European Commission has officially launched an antitrust investigation into Meta’s 'pay or consent' approach. The model requires users to either pay or agree to data collection to access the platform. Regulators argue this could be exploitative, especially for users who feel compelled to hand over personal information to avoid losing service access. Immediate interim measures are reportedly under consideration to prevent ongoing privacy breaches while the probe continues.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nBrussels is emphasizing that digital platforms can’t treat user data as a bargaining chip. This investigation comes amid broader EU efforts to assert authority over Big Tech, with rules like the Digital Services Act and Digital Markets Act already setting high compliance bars. Meta faces the possibility of having to redesign consent flows or payment models to meet EU standards.\n\nGlobal Implications\n\nThe outcome could ripple well beyond Europe. Changes to Meta’s model could influence other social media platforms and digital services worldwide, shifting ad-driven revenue strategies and setting new expectations for privacy compliance. Companies with EU user bases may need to adapt quickly to avoid penalties or reputational damage.\n\nIndustry Watch\n\nTech analysts are closely following how Meta responds, particularly whether the company will implement immediate fixes or challenge the Commission’s interim measures. The investigation may set a precedent for how aggressively regulators monitor data monetization and user consent practices in digital markets globally.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThe EU is sending a clear message: user data is not a bargaining chip. Meta’s interim adjustments and long-term compliance strategies will be closely watched, potentially shaping privacy and regulatory standards worldwide. The investigation underscores Europe’s growing influence over global digital policy.",
