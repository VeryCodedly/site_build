      "content_plain_text": "This week in tech came with quieter shifts that could shape the next phase of AI, digital money, global regulation, and infrastructure. Some headlines were loud, but the stories that matter most happened below the noise. Here are the five stories with the biggest long-term impact.\n\n1. Klarna Enters The Stablecoin Market With KlarnaUSD\n\nKlarna introduced a new US dollar backed stablecoin called KlarnaUSD. It runs on Tempo, a blockchain network supported by companies like Stripe and Paradigm. This move shifts stablecoins from niche crypto tools into mainstream payment infrastructure and could reduce cross-border transaction costs.\n\n2. Google Expands Its AI Chips Program Into Space\n\nGoogle revealed early plans to test AI chips in orbit through partnerships focused on satellite based compute. The goal is to reduce latency for Earth observation, climate modeling, and disaster response. While details are still developing, the idea marks a shift toward distributed compute that includes space based infrastructure.\n\n3. Regulators Move Quickly On Stablecoin Rules\n\nMultiple markets, including the EU and parts of Asia, released updated guidance for how stablecoins should operate. The focus is transparency, reserves, and consumer protection. Governments now see stablecoins as part of everyday finance rather than an experimental asset class.\n\n4. Open Source AI Usage Surges In China\n\nA new report showed that China now leads the world in downloads of open AI models from major repositories. This reflects a shift toward globally distributed innovation and increased competition among independent model developers and regional tech ecosystems.\n\n5. Enterprise AI Moves Toward Efficiency, Not Scale\n\nAcross the industry, companies are shifting away from large, high compute models toward smaller and more efficient ones. New documentation from cloud providers and AI vendors focuses on cost reduction, energy use, and practical deployment. This trend signals a new era where efficiency becomes a competitive advantage.\n\nFrom space based AI experiments to new digital currency infrastructure, this week's developments point toward a more distributed, regulated, and efficiency focused tech landscape. Quiet changes, big long-term effects.",
