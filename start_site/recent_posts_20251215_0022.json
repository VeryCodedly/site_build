      "content_plain_text": "TIME did something a little different with its Person of the Year pick this time. No single face, no lone visionary on the cover. Instead, the magazine named the “Architects of AI” as its 2025 honorees, which feels like an admission that artificial intelligence has officially outgrown the idea of one main character.\n\nThe spotlight lands on the people building the systems behind the boom, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rather than framing AI as one sudden breakthrough, TIME tells a slower story about years of infrastructure work, model tuning, and strategic bets that gradually turned research projects into tools used by hundreds of millions of people.\n\nWhen AI Became Normal\n\nA big reason for the recognition is how completely AI has blended into everyday life. Generative models now sit inside search, productivity apps, creative tools, and customer support systems. What once sounded like a demo video now casually shows up in meeting notes, image cleanups, and code suggestions, usually without anyone stopping to call it “AI” anymore.\n\nTIME also leaned into the fact that this isn’t a one-country story. While U.S. companies dominate many conversations, advances from China and other regions continue to push the field forward. AI development has become global, competitive, and deeply tied to national policy, investment priorities, and long-term tech strategy.\n\nPower Comes With Fine Print\n\nNaming AI’s builders as Person of the Year is also a quiet acknowledgment of how much influence a relatively small group of companies and executives now hold. Decisions about how models are trained, released, and limited don’t stay technical for long. They ripple into education, media, healthcare, and politics, whether anyone planned for that or not.\n\nThe whole thing feels less like a trophy moment and more like a checkpoint. AI is established enough to be unavoidable, but still early enough to be steered. What happens next probably won’t hinge on a flashy launch, but on a long series of smaller choices made behind the scenes. And those choices are only just starting to matter.",
