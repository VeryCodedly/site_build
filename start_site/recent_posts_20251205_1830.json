This helps you write cleaner, more maintainable front-end templates without having to split everything into multiple files or rely on external template‑fragment libraries.\n\nWhy This Feels Like a Milestone\n\nWith 6.0, Django feels more ‘batteries included’ than ever. For small to medium‑sized apps (or junior devs) this lowers the barrier to building full-featured, secure web applications. You don’t have to piece together five different libraries just to send an email in the background or lock down security headers. It’s streamlined, practical, and aimed at real-world web work.",
      "excerpt": "Django 6.0 adds native background tasks, CSP, template partials and more. A major upgrade making web development more efficient, secure, and friendly for Python devs.",
